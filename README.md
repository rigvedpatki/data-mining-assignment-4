# Graph Spectra

## Task

In this homework you are to study, implement and to test the spectral graph clustering algorithm as described in the paper “On Spectral Clustering: Analysis and an algorithm” (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. by Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan, Yair Weiss. Using your implementation of the K-eigenvector algorithm, you are to analyse two sample graphs.

1. A real graph “example1.dat” -- This data set was prepared by Ron Burt. He dug out the 1966 data collected by Coleman, Katz and Menzel on medical innovation (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. They had collected data from physicians in four towns in Illinois, Peoria, Bloomington, Quincy and Galesburg.
2. A synthetic graph “example2.dat”

You can choose any language to implement the algorithm. Using Matlab/Octave, the algorithm can be implemented in few lines of code Matlab/Octave. As a KTH student you can obtain a student license for Matlab by following this link (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. Find below a short Matlab tutorial for this homework.

It is recommended that you read the above paper first, as implementing the algorithm should be trivial. As a warm up task, you should first compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a set of graphs, and find out how many communities do these graphs have. You will find it trivial if you are already familiar with Matlab.
